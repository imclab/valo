Python
------

See interfaces/colorselect.py for a GTK color chooser.

Here is a simple snippet which defines set_light function:

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import socket
import struct
import time

addr = ("valot.instanssi.org", 9909)
UDPSock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

def set_light(i, r,g,b):
    command_out = struct.pack('>LLBBB',0,i,r,g,b)
    UDPSock.sendto(command_out, addr)

# Let's try that one.
for i in range(32, 46):
    print "Light number ", i
    set_light(i, 0, 255, 0)
    time.sleep(0.2)
    set_light(i, 255, 0, 0)

mIRC
----

AirZero coded an alias for mIRC to change lights via IRC. Before this
I didn't even think about mIRC is capable of posting UDP packets :D To
use this, you need to have udp-example/1-black.dat in a suitable
directory for mIRC. Also, change server_address to your light server IP.

on 1:TEXT:epilepsia*:#:{ msg $chan $nick changed the colour
	/vari $2 $3 $4
}

/bread 1-black.dat 0 11 &flash

alias vari {
      /bset &flash 9 $1 $2 $3
      /sockudp -k socketname server_address 9909 &flash
}
