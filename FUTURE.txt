Future expansions

First some small things to do:

- Support for packets containing settings for multiple lamps

Then, some bigger ones:

Light simulator
===============

The inspiration behind this is to simulate the lamps virtually when
there are no real equipment. Simulator allows the user to sync his/her
multimedia splatting perfectly.

Simulator listen to UDP port 9909 (which Valo normally listens) and
receives light commands. When a packet is received, the color is
changed on the screen.

This may be either little Qt application or even a massive OpenGL
visualizator. You can pick anything.

The current UDP protocol is specified in README-udp.txt. Only two
lights are present on my real hardware so the simulator doesn't need
to support more yet.

Please help me with this. I'm incompetent with graphics.
