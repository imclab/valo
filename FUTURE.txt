First some small things to do:

- None

Then, some bigger ones:

Light simulator
===============

The inspiration behind this is to simulate the lamps virtually when
there is no real equipment. Simulator allows the user to sync his/her
multimedia splatting perfectly.

Simulator listen to UDP port 9909 (which Valo normally listens) and
receives light commands. When a packet is received, the color is
changed on the screen.

This may be either little Qt application or even a massive OpenGL
visualizator. You can pick anything.

The current UDP protocol is specified in README-udp.txt. Only two
lights are present on my real hardware so the simulator doesn't need
to support more yet.

Please help me with this. I'm incompetent with graphics.

More inputs and outputs
================

Different kinds of buses:

- DMX bus (supported)
- Simulator bus
- UDP output bus
- File writer bus

User friendly programs

- lightSource (missing main functino)
- lightSimulator

Tracker reader
=========

Reads Schism Tracker (or any other tracker) files and plays back light
commands as the file is played back. That way it is easy for musicians
to design light shows, too.

This may require some metadata for mapping the channels and notes to
lights and colours.
